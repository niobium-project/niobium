description: Why Niobium exists, who maintains it, and what support to expect.

Niobium is an independent open source installer framework maintained by one person in spare time. Maintenance is best effort, with a focused scope and a short platform list.

## Background

The project grew out of installer needs the author encountered while working at TongYuan, including internal, experimental and commercial products. Niobium is a general-purpose framework with no product-specific dependencies.

Niobium is maintained independently and is not part of TongYuan's commercial products. TongYuan provides no direct support or direction for the project.

## Maintenance strategy

- **Best effort, no service level.** There is one maintainer and no guaranteed response time for issues, pull requests or questions.
- **Explicit capability boundaries.** Products extend installers through language SDKs, Starlark and fixed Wasm capability libraries. The host controls machine authority, resource ownership and transaction recovery. See the [project overview](/).
- **Few platforms, done properly.** Effort goes to the Tier 1 platforms first; the tiers and the roadmap are on [Platform support](/platforms/).
- **Pre-1.0.** Formats and interfaces may still change. Each change to a contract is recorded as a decision in the repository, and the verified state of each feature is on [Status and platforms](/status/).
- **Security reports** follow the process on [Security](/security/).
- **Contributions** are welcome when they follow the repository conventions in [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/niobium-project/niobium/blob/main/AGENTS.md). Merging a contribution is not guaranteed, and a contributed port needs someone who will keep it tested.
