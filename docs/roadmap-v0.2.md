# Roadmap v0.2 (adoptable by a product team)

Goal: turn the model proven in [v0.1](roadmap-v0.1.md) into something a product team can adopt. Every feature lives in one built-in module, a product developer gets from nothing to a signed installer quickly, and the Tier 1 platforms have real-OS evidence.

The user-facing wording of each item is owned by the [Roadmap](../apps/user-docs/src/content/docs/roadmap.md) page of the user site; this file maps those items to work and records. Items are in priority order. Feature modules come first because integrations, in-app updates and presets build on them; the production-readiness lanes run in parallel.

## Scope

| User roadmap item | Maintainer work | Record |
|---|---|---|
| Built-in feature modules | One module interface for capabilities and distribution features: schema fragment, validation, planner, per-platform backend, undo and uninstall, helper operation, conformance cases. Port ManagedFiles, Directory, Shortcut, FileAssociation, Service and ApplicationRegistration, then online and offline sources and channels | [ADR-0018](adr/0018-built-in-feature-modules.md) (Proposed) |
| Presets and themes | Versioned preset data and a scaffold command that writes ordinary `product.json`, `component.json` and branding files; a closed set of installer themes on the token pipeline; preview of the installer window before publishing | [ADR-0019](adr/0019-presets-and-themes.md) (Proposed), [ADR-0008](adr/0008-shared-software-renderer.md), [ADR-0009](adr/0009-zon-screen-ir-and-tokens-codegen.md) |
| Production-ready on macOS, Windows and Linux | Tier 1 real-OS lanes (x86_64 Ubuntu 24.04 guest, native x64 Windows 11), machine-scope smoke, the macOS GUI walkthrough, a pinned minimum macOS version, Authenticode and Developer ID signing with notarization | [ADR-0014](adr/0014-tier-based-platform-support.md), [vm-smoke](runbooks/vm-smoke.md), [release-signing](runbooks/release-signing.md) |
| Easier to adopt | Prebuilt `setup`, `nbpack` and `libdistribution` for the Tier 1 targets, built once and signed once; a compatibility promise for the build API | ADR to be written |
| More system integrations | ProtocolHandler and EnvironmentEntry (including `PATH`) as feature modules, with removal on uninstall and conformance cases on every Tier 1 backend | ADR-0018, [platform-contract-v1](spec/platform-contract-v1.md), source v0.1 section 7 |
| In-app updates for any application | The Node-API package `distribution.node` over the existing engine; examples of the C ABI from other languages | [ADR-0002](adr/0002-library-first-core-and-c-abi.md), [abi-v1](spec/abi-v1.md) |
| Online, offline-file and SFX delivery | Three delivery milestones with a shared engine; settle container layouts, final signing, antivirus gates, resource budgets, offline validity and maintainer lifetime | [ADR-0020](adr/0020-distribution-delivery-milestones.md), [distribution backlog](development/distribution-backlog.md) |

## Carried forward from v0.1

These acceptance entries keep their IDs and belong to the production-readiness item:

| ID | Status in v0.1 | What closes it |
|---|---|---|
| N1-UJ-02 | `BLOCKED` | A machine-scope run in `tools/vm-smoke` on a running VM |
| N1-UJ-10 | `NOT_RUN` | The manual macOS walkthrough of the five screens |
| N1-AC-18 | `BLOCKED` | vm-smoke on Windows 11 |
| N1-AC-19 | `BLOCKED` | vm-smoke on Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64 |

Outstanding maintainer task: host the upstream files from `deps.zon` on a self-hosted mirror so a first build no longer depends on GitHub or jsDelivr ([ADR-0011](adr/0011-third-party-fetch.md)).

## Acceptance

[acceptance-plan-v0.1](acceptance-plan-v0.1.md) stays the active acceptance file, and `tools/check-docs` keeps reading it through `acceptance_path`. `acceptance-plan-v0.2.md` opens when the first v0.2 spec defines new acceptance IDs: in that change, `acceptance_path` switches to the new file, the entries above move with their numbers, and the v0.1 plan is frozen ([docs-management](development/docs-management.md#roadmap-and-acceptance-plan)).

## Test-system construction

The [test-system specification](spec/test-system-v1.md) owns the contract. This table tracks
construction, separately from execution verdicts. `supported` means repeatable evidence for the
named scope; `working` means implementation has gaps with exit criteria; `not yet supported`
means planned with prerequisites; `not planned` means deliberately excluded. Target assignments
remain in [Platform support](../apps/user-docs/src/content/docs/platforms.md); tier obligations
remain in [ADR-0014](adr/0014-tier-based-platform-support.md).

| Capability | Applicable environments | Acceptance IDs | Construction | Remaining work / exit criteria | Evidence |
