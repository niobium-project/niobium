# Acceptance plan v0.1

Status uses only `PASS`, `FAIL`, `BLOCKED`, `NOT_RUN`, `DEFERRED`. Every entry whose "Coverage" column is `zig test` must be cited by at least one test name (checked by `tools/check-docs`).

Basis for status: `zig build verify` passes on a macOS aarch64 host (covering all entries with `zig test` and `build` coverage), and the e2e suite also passes in a Debian bookworm arm64 container; e2e evidence is in `.evidence/e2e/<UTC>/`. The reason for the `BLOCKED` entries is in `.evidence/vm-smoke/<UTC>/summary.txt`: neither VM was running, and the tool does not start them without `--start` ([vm-smoke](runbooks/vm-smoke.md)). N1-UJ-02 additionally needs machine scope, while `tools/vm-smoke` currently runs only user scope. N1-UJ-10 is a manual item: on a macOS host, run `zig build example`, then open `zig-out/example/setup` and walk through all five screens.

## Test-system validation 2026-10-07

These results cover the automation foundation working tree based on
`99448d398f097213b72f1976252c244d9190e650`, with `dirty=true`, Zig 0.17.0 and a native macOS
aarch64 host. They do not certify an unchanged HEAD or any later revision. The full change exceeds
300 net lines because the approved delivery spans the report contract, build graph, probes and CI;
implementation was applied in bounded patches. No new lint suppressions were introduced (66 total).

| Validation | Verdict | Evidence / limits |
|---|---|---|
| `zig build verify --cache-poison=disallowed --summary failures` | PASS | Final local gate after ZIP extraction checks, including native cases, golden, sim, C smoke, ThreadSanitizer, cross compilation, binary and size gates |
| `zig build test c-smoke --summary failures` | PASS | Default selection and compatibility alias; host contracts: `.evidence/conformance/1791357834297-suite-conformance-68270b21b47d2901/report.json` |
| `zig build test -Dsuite=e2e -Dcase=online-lifecycle --summary failures` | PASS | Filtered lifecycle: `.evidence/e2e/1791357448923-suite-e2e-483751b500cdc93f/report.json` |

| Unknown suite/case, zero seeds, narrowing verify | PASS | CLI invocations rejected with exit 1; narrowing verify ran no test nodes |
| Saved lifecycle validation through `zig build evidence -Daction=validate` | PASS | Saved report: `.evidence/e2e/1791358963767-suite-e2e-599ea13fb6dff571/report.json` |
| Partial reports, unsupported contracts, missing/changed evidence, deadlines and output limits | PASS | Evidence-tool and conformance regression tests, including link/traversal ZIP rejection; `.evidence/unit/1791358961538-tool-evidence-0bd0862ca45049a9/report.json` |
| Wrong generation, corrupt payload and lost application data | PASS | Independent negative controls and lifecycle cases: `.evidence/e2e/1791358963767-suite-e2e-599ea13fb6dff571/report.json` |
| CI aggregate and path selection | PASS | Local shell checks: seven job-status combinations and five changed-path cases; workflow YAML parsed |
| Windows evidence-tool cross compilation | PASS | `zig build-exe -target x86_64-windows` with contracts/catalog module inputs; compilation only |
| `zig build test -Dsuite=fuzz -Dcontinuous-fuzz --fuzz=1000 --summary failures` | BLOCKED | Native fuzzer rebuild fails with unresolved `___sanitizer_cov_trace_*` symbols from zstd on this macOS toolchain; corpus replay is separate |
| R2 upload/readback, duplicate/conflict/interruption, pagination and deployed lifecycle | PASS | Real US-jurisdiction private Standard bucket; scoped keys stored in the main-only GitHub environment; monthly ordinary-evidence rules read back and live Zig verification passed (deployment record below) |
| Selected Ubuntu/Windows/macOS CI jobs | PASS | [Run 37601399813](https://github.com/niobium-project/niobium/actions/runs/37601399813) at `f2171a1`: all three native unit/conformance/e2e jobs and required `linux` aggregate passed; macOS also ran ThreadSanitizer |
| Trusted fork publisher workflow | PASS | Deployed verification and limits are recorded in the R2 deployment table below |
| Reference-OS elevation, desktop, signed release bytes and viewer | NOT_RUN | Separate roadmap prerequisites; hosted contracts do not satisfy L5 |

The earlier sandbox `manifest_create PermissionDenied` was resolved for validation by running
approved Zig build commands outside that filesystem sandbox. It was not bypassed by weakening any
repository check. Saved reports and their attachments remain local under `.evidence/` until an
explicit publication succeeds; the links above are working-copy evidence, not committed fixtures.
The R2 deployment record below supplies the archive evidence for the construction roadmap.

The subsequent platform fixes in `ea45cce` passed
`zig build verify -Dseeds=2000 --cache-poison=disallowed --summary failures` on native macOS
aarch64 (working tree based on `b38746c`, `dirty=true`). Evidence includes
`.evidence/conformance/1791361295064-suite-conformance-62a571380a8399fe/report.json`,
`.evidence/e2e/1791361397430-suite-e2e-72949fdfbf2c260f/report.json`, and
`.evidence/sim/1791361322875-suite-sim-5ddad716e49b34d7/report.json` (2,000 seeds).
The Windows path-normalization regression failed before the fix. Hosted runs also exposed an
unrelated advisory Codecov upload failure requiring service authentication; coverage tests passed.

The final local gate, `zig build verify -Dseeds=2000 --cache-poison=disallowed --summary failures`,
also passed on clean commit `576dd551c68e4bca4a98e39d02d24cfe42212ea0` (`dirty=false`). Its evidence is
`.evidence/conformance/1791363253246-suite-conformance-11ac52df3ae13f24/report.json`,
`.evidence/e2e/1791363236630-suite-e2e-35224263fe16a273/report.json`, and
`.evidence/sim/1791363214648-suite-sim-4bd885966979559c/report.json`.
Windows native validation required fixing directory-link cleanup, junction path normalization,
snapshot canonicalization, registry handle ABI, and planner registration targets. The planner
regression checks every generated Windows integration target against platform validation.
The earlier [failed run](https://github.com/niobium-project/niobium/actions/runs/37593700618)
retains partial case evidence; offline validation of its Windows report succeeded with verdict FAIL.
Hosted evidence remains downloadable from the linked runs; the deployment record below identifies
the current R2 archive status.


## R2 deployment validation 2026-10-08

The deployment uses `org-niobium-project-dev-assets` and `ci-evidence/YYYY-MM/`. The source
attempt's UTC start chooses the month, so retries retain their keys. Cloudflare configuration
readback verified private access, Standard storage, twelve 90-day ordinary-evidence prefixes
(October 2026–September 2027), and preservation of the existing seven-day multipart-abort rule.
The object read/write credential is scoped to this bucket and stored in the `test-evidence`
GitHub environment, whose deployment policy remains restricted to `main`.

| Validation | Verdict | Evidence / limits |
|---|---|---|
| `zig build test -Dsuite=unit -Dr2-live=true` | PASS | Real conditional writes, digest readback, identical/conflicting publication, report-last recovery, paginated listing and incomplete multipart upload/abort. Concurrent distinct payloads passed: `.evidence/unit/1791391304729-tool-evidence-5e27ce8a69c8b6b0/report.json` (working tree based on `f2171a1`, dirty). Its report and logs are persisted under `ci-evidence/2026-10/` |
| `zig build verify --cache-poison=disallowed --summary failures` | PASS | Clean `28ca68ff6d83b43ed3deb186fb5e8f6db9607990`; conformance `.evidence/conformance/1791391945046-suite-conformance-e56190e63d678af9/report.json`, e2e `.evidence/e2e/1791391862260-suite-e2e-e5b4b3756f79759b/report.json`, sim `.evidence/sim/1791391853685-suite-sim-eec93205f8356e5b/report.json` |
| Native Ubuntu/Windows/macOS and aggregate | PASS | [Replacement CI run](https://github.com/niobium-project/niobium/actions/runs/37658039579) on `28ca68f`; all selected jobs and `linux` passed. The [original PR run](https://github.com/niobium-project/niobium/actions/runs/37655224913) hit a GitHub internal error after native jobs passed, before its aggregate started; its records remain intact |
| Trusted default-branch and fork publication | PASS | [Automatic main publisher](https://github.com/niobium-project/niobium/actions/runs/37689468745) and [fork publisher](https://github.com/niobium-project/niobium/actions/runs/37688512199) succeeded on trusted `879a89e`; 157 and 118 reports respectively, with evidence digest readback |
| Review fixes and credential-safe diagnostics | PASS | `zig build verify --cache-poison=disallowed --summary failures` on clean `0eeebcf`; conformance `.evidence/conformance/1791403507408-suite-conformance-8266ded1c71071be/report.json`, e2e `.evidence/e2e/1791403478819-suite-e2e-95c5bdaa98938bf7/report.json`, sim `.evidence/sim/1791403507577-suite-sim-8fb4a2f9a879de39/report.json` |
| Bounded native transport retries | PASS | Full `zig build verify --cache-poison=disallowed --summary failures` on clean `6e59033`; conformance `.evidence/conformance/1791404391633-suite-conformance-f05ae06da10a2f00/report.json`, e2e `.evidence/e2e/1791404415720-suite-e2e-aacb2cb4ab223a02/report.json`, sim `.evidence/sim/1791404408066-suite-sim-9e80a371e7d9dcae/report.json`. Standard SDK retries have three attempts and a subprocess deadline; tests are not retried |
| Fresh protected PR aggregate | PASS | [CI run 37660875144](https://github.com/niobium-project/niobium/actions/runs/37660875144) on `ebaaf37`: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS and required `linux` succeeded; corrected current-code gates are recorded below |
| Signed revision live provider check | PASS | Clean `6b29d2b`: `zig build test -Dsuite=unit -Dr2-live=true`; `.evidence/unit/1791405030913-tool-evidence-51d1cc3838339f51/report.json`, explicitly published with digest readback |
| Deployed native gate | PASS | [Main CI run 37682590119](https://github.com/niobium-project/niobium/actions/runs/37682590119) on signed merge `789cf95`: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS and required `linux` passed; the separate Codecov upload still requires authentication |
| Fork credential isolation and aggregate | PASS | [Fork run 37683496636](https://github.com/niobium-project/niobium/actions/runs/37683496636): environment policy denied Windows before any steps ran; Ubuntu/macOS passed and the aggregate correctly failed. Its opaque script marker was present in the downloaded source ZIP and absent from publisher execution logs; the publisher treats artifact files as data |
| Saturated worker deadline regression | PASS | Regression first failed with inline sleeping, then passed with a concurrent timer; full `zig build verify --cache-poison=disallowed --summary failures` passed on `6b29d2b` with the fix (dirty). Conformance `.evidence/conformance/1791406449241-suite-conformance-b0f4d735ab05af4c/report.json`, e2e `.evidence/e2e/1791406466138-suite-e2e-c8006eb942a05039/report.json`, sim `.evidence/sim/1791406459496-suite-sim-83a768e1ba7bdb03/report.json` |
| Deadline fix initial native gate | FAIL | [Run 37685855188](https://github.com/niobium-project/niobium/actions/runs/37685855188) on `a222b6d`: saturated-worker regression passed on Windows, but the older PowerShell fixture reached its deadline without captured output. Partial failure evidence remains downloadable |
| Lightweight timeout fixture local gate | PASS | Full `zig build verify --cache-poison=disallowed --summary failures` passed on macOS with the fixture update (`a222b6d`, dirty); `.evidence/conformance/1791407355101-suite-conformance-1c4302af784f2b02/report.json` and `.evidence/e2e/1791407356239-suite-e2e-b4470f050bfad433/report.json`. Bounded native cmd loops retain exact stdout/stderr, deadline and overflow assertions; native validation is recorded below |
| Corrected native gates | PASS | [PR run 37687634857](https://github.com/niobium-project/niobium/actions/runs/37687634857) on `eb290db` and [main run 37688502195](https://github.com/niobium-project/niobium/actions/runs/37688502195) on `879a89e`: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS and required `linux` passed; Codecov upload authentication remains separate |
| Partial publication recovery and duplicate objects | PASS | [Publisher 37688506992](https://github.com/niobium-project/niobium/actions/runs/37688506992) completed all 157 saved reports from source `37660875144`, reusing identical objects from interrupted local/deployed publication |
| Failed native evidence preservation | PASS | [Publisher 37688518320](https://github.com/niobium-project/niobium/actions/runs/37688518320) archived all 157 reports from failed source `37685855188`. Downloaded Windows tool evidence passed `evidence -Daction=validate` while retaining test verdict FAIL: `.evidence/readback-37685855188-mn0qpl2t/report.json` |
| Fork and main independent archive validation | PASS | Bounded object downloads passed `zig build evidence -Daction=validate`: `.evidence/readback-37683496636-xw_za1ya/report.json` retains fork repository/revision and workflow failure; `.evidence/readback-37688502195-8ja_w7bb/report.json` identifies tested main `879a89e`. Neither operation ran saved artifacts |

Provider verification does not substitute for the trusted CI publication check. The configured
retention horizon must be renewed before September 2027 ends; a missing ordinary-object expiry
fails publication. Advisory Codecov upload authentication remains separate from test verdicts.

The publisher runs from signed, trusted `main` revision `879a89e`. Initial publication exposed
inline async sleeping under worker saturation; the concurrent-timer regression and corrected
native gates above verify its resolution. Publication recovery used saved evidence without
rerunning source tests or replacing archive objects. The disposable fork verification PR was
closed after its evidence checks; its source branch remains available for audit.
