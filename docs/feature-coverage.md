# Installer framework feature coverage

> Scope: legacy feature inventory. Target ownership and follow-on work are defined by [module boundaries](architecture/module-boundaries.md) and [roadmap v0.2](roadmap-v0.2.md).

This catalog proposes the coverage boundary for Niobium across authoring, distribution, deployment and maintenance. Each row names a capability and an acceptance question. It does not declare implementation, platform support or release commitments.

The [current roadmap](roadmap-v0.2.md) owns scheduled work. The [acceptance plan](acceptance-plan-v0.1.md) owns actual results. Existing contracts remain authoritative through the [documentation index](README.md#specifications-normative).

## Reading the catalog

| Boundary | Meaning | Change authority |
|---|---|---|
| B | A current contract covers this capability; evidence still needs checking | The linked spec and accepted ADRs |
| C | A candidate for framework-owned functionality | Design review, contract and acceptance work before implementation |
| I | An integration owned by the build pipeline, application or deployment operator | The integration contract; no runtime installer plugins |
| X | Excluded under the current architecture | A new decision is required to change the boundary |

Priority is a proposal: P0 protects deployment integrity or release trust; P1 enables product adoption; P2 expands advanced use cases. Priority does not change the current roadmap. X rows use no priority.

FC identifiers are catalog references, not product acceptance IDs. B means contract coverage, not PASS. Candidates have no assumed schema fields or CLI commands. Platform coverage is evaluated separately for each OS, architecture and user/machine scope.

## Evidence and source ownership

Each implemented row needs a linked contract, scenario, platform/scope matrix and retained evidence. Use only PASS, FAIL, BLOCKED, NOT_RUN or DEFERRED for execution results. A scanner outage or stale database is an explicit outcome, never a clean scan. No new product PASS is asserted by this catalog.

Security gates cover source and dependencies, payloads, final signed installers and retained releases. Reports record tool version, advisory snapshot, scope, omissions, findings and artifact digest. Scan immutable final bytes before promotion; remediation creates new artifacts under a new authorized release sequence. Signing, SBOM presence, provenance verification and malware scanning answer different questions.

The governing owners are [manifest](spec/manifest-v1.md), [component](spec/component-v1.md), [artifact](spec/artifact-format-v1.md), [TUF](spec/tuf-profile-v1.md), [CLI](spec/cli-v1.md), [ABI](spec/abi-v1.md), [Bootstrap](spec/bootstrap-v1.md), [platform](spec/platform-contract-v1.md), [IPC](spec/ipc-v1.md), [UI](spec/ui-ir-v1.md), [transactions](architecture/transaction-model.md) and [testing lanes](development/testing-lanes.md). A broad B row does not expand these contracts. Known discovery, cross-user locking, helper and platform restrictions remain applicable.

Feature modules and themes remain proposals in [ADR-0018](adr/0018-built-in-feature-modules.md) and [ADR-0019](adr/0019-presets-and-themes.md). Dependency solving, native exporters, enterprise policy and report formats need their own contracts before implementation. No decision status changes through this catalog.

Upstream references, consulted on 2026-10-07: [NSIS scripting](https://github.com/NSIS-Dev/nsis/blob/master/Docs/src/basic.but), [Inno Setup](https://github.com/jrsoftware/issrc), [WiX](https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix), [Qt IFW](https://github.com/qtproject/installer-framework), [Electron Builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder), [PyInstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller) and [CPack](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/tree/master/Modules) identify the technologies considered. Their behavior does not establish Niobium implementation coverage.
Scanning references, consulted on 2026-10-07: [OSV-Scanner](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner) for dependency-advisory matching, [CycloneDX](https://github.com/CycloneDX/specification) for SBOM and exploitability statements, and [SLSA artifact verification](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa/blob/main/spec/verifying-artifacts.md) for provenance bound to artifact identity and trusted builders. Integration choices require separate evaluation.
